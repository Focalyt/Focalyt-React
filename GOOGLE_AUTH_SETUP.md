# Frontend-Only Google Authentication Setup

## 🎯 What's Implemented

✅ **Frontend-only Google authentication** that logs everything to the console  
✅ **No backend integration required** - everything happens in the browser  
✅ **Modern Google Identity Services** - uses the latest Google authentication  
✅ **Detailed console logging** - you can see all authentication details  

## 🚀 How to Test

1. **Open your B2B Sales page**
2. **Open browser console** (F12 → Console tab)
3. **Click "Sign in with Google"** button
4. **Watch the console logs** - you'll see detailed information about:
   - Google Identity Services loading
   - Authentication response
   - Decoded user information
   - Token details

## 📋 Console Output You'll See

When you sign in, you'll see logs like:
